10/12/2023 - Alpha 1.0 First build, completed in time for my anniversary with my girlfriend. Note, this build is not currently optimized in any way and is more a demonstration/proof of concept of what the game will ultimately look be. Text is currently not sized correctly for most screens and the follower body parts of the character do not follow at the correct speed. Fixes coming soon.

10/27/2023 - Alpha 1.1 Second playable build, a much cleaner build. Fixed the bug with text sizing and updated the game's movement to improve collision detection. Followers should also follow at proper speed but will test on the actual build tomorrow.

11/29/2023 - Alpha 1.2 A smaller update for the new player model. Also includes an update to the follower script to make their movement smoother and eliminate the jumpiness that was more noticable with the new more complex model as well as changes to level 5 to make the path to follow clearer.

12/13/2023 - Alpha 1.2.1 - A small update, beginnings of work on Level 6 and some tinkering with gravity manipulation.
